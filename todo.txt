[ ] mcp.js: calculate true cost of all augs and only buy when the cash is available
[ ] mcp.js: if we dont have enough money to purchase all queued augs, skip augs that are from donatable factions
[ ] general: outline path to ascension
    [ ] figure out overlapping augs for mainline hack factions
    [ ] find all non-hack factions with hack or rep augs
    [ ] make a list of all faction:aug pairs in order of rep and decide how much rep is required for each outline
    [ ] write library that evaluates progress and can be queried to ask for next faction to join/work/contract
[ ] general: transtion codebase to vscode-template
    - dependent on if work PC can run node.js ts compiler
    - https://github.com/bitburner-official/vscode-template
[ ] sleeve.js: add mode to work for faction/job, prioritized by needed augs
    - depends on library that figures out ascension goals and progress
    [ ] basic/brute implementation can be to work joined factions in order of totalRep if they have outstanding
        augs and have not hit the donation limit
[ ] NEW: write script to track work and quit and move on to next milestone when any of the following
    - working and hit faction join limit
    - contracting and hit donation limit
    - contracting and hit price of target aug (might not be most expensive aug if another faction sells duplicates)
    - next milestone functionality depends on library that figures out ascension goals and progress
    [ ] basic/brute implementation can be to quit on basic limits (max aug/domation limit/faction join limit) and
        move on to the faction with the next highest rep that has not hit the limits
[ ] NEW: write orchestrator to distribute and execute share.js script
[ ] gang.js: use an arg to switch between hacking/combat gang mode or figure out programatically
[ ] gang.js: change member's task from training to useful tasks when stat multiplier is > x55 (actual is somewhere around x61, but has to at least be > x30) and stat > 10000
[ ] gang.js: shuffle around tasks such that in-traing members are training and active members are balanced between income, rep and wanted
    - focus on rep over income when < some number of augs are queued up
    - focus on rep when more members can be hired
    - focus on income when we dont need rep
    - always have enough wanted reduction to counter actions of other active members
[ ] hack: instead of canceling a batch when the script finish time finishes early, update the offset time to be accurate, re-insert it into the
    execute list and resort the execute list
[ ] mcp.js: automatically join factions that dont exclude other factions
[ ] sleeve.js: buy augmentations before reboot
[ ] hacknet.js: generate coding contracts while profitable
[ ] stat.js: write status script
[ ] mcp.js: when top rep faction is my gang, dont buy neuroflux from them and dont factor their rep
    - Time played/since aug/since node
    - Status of scripts
        - cct
        - corp
        - clock
        - gang
        - smart_hack
        - hacknet/leech
    - sleeve status
    - hacknet income/target
    - corp income
    - gang stats (members, income)
    - karma
    - bought servers/sizes
    - home server size
